Create a Test Case
That Validates the
Animal REST API
Background
Many of our projects require interfacing with a backend data source to populate the browser interface.  
To assist us in understanding how you would develop a project using a dynamic backend data source, 
we have created a RESTful API for you to use to develop a set of test case.

Technical Details
The description of the RESTful API is available at https://animalrestapi.azurewebsites.net/.  
Feel free to contact us if you have any questions.
The API is seeded with three results, 1, 2, and 3, which can not be deleted.  
However, all other results can be deleted.

An example URI would be: https://animalrestapi.azurewebsites.net/Animal/List

Goals
Create a test case to validate the API using your prefered test tool(s). 
The interface must utilize all the capabilities of the API.
Please be as thorough as possible in testing all conditions.
Please include any code written for the automated tests.
